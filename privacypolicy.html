                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    Welcome to our website! We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a secure online experience. As a static website, our approach to data collection and usage is inherently minimal and significantly more privacy-friendly than most dynamic websites. This policy details how we handle information related to your visit.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    Our primary goal is to deliver valuable content and resources while ensuring your peace of mind regarding your personal data.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    A static website is composed of fixed, pre-built files (such as HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript) that are directly served to your browser. Unlike dynamic websites, static sites do not typically process user input on a server, interact with databases, or run complex server-side applications that store user data.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    This architecture significantly limits the potential for personal data collection and inherently enhances security. Without server-side processing of user data or direct database interactions, many common vulnerabilities exploited for data breaches are simply not present.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    Given the static nature of this website, we do not directly:

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    While we prioritize maximum privacy, some minimal, non-identifiable data may be passively collected by our hosting provider for essential website operation, security, and aggregated performance analysis:

                        <strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Server Access Logs:</strong> Our web hosting provider automatically logs standard, non-personal information such as your IP address (anonymized or truncated where possible), browser type, operating system, referring pages, and timestamps of visits. This data is used for server maintenance, security monitoring, and generating aggregated, anonymized traffic statistics. We do not have direct access to or process this data for individual identification.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        <strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Optional Anonymous Analytics:</strong> We may choose to use a privacy-focused analytics solution (e.g., Plausible Analytics, GoatCounter, or similar self-hosted options) that specifically collects only aggregated and anonymized data about website traffic (e.g., page views, popular content, traffic sources). This type of data cannot be used to identify individual visitors and helps us understand overall content consumption to improve the website's structure and offerings. <span class="text-sm text-gray-500 italic">(Note: As of this policy's last update, we are not utilizing any third-party analytics that collect personal data.)</span>

                    None of the above information is linked to any personal identifiers, nor is it used for profiling, targeted advertising, or any purpose beyond general website improvement and security.

                    In very limited circumstances, a purely functional, non-identifying cookie might be used (e.g., to remember your preference for a dark/light theme). Such cookies are strictly necessary for basic site functionality and do not store any personal data.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                    The static nature of this website inherently provides a high level of security. Without databases or server-side applications that process user data, the common attack vectors for data breaches (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting on dynamic content) are largely eliminated.
